# pokemons

This project was made when training to use Ionic Cordova at [Webforce3 Coding School](https://www.wf3.fr/). 
The aim was to recreate a small Android App using Ionic Capacitor and Angular framework. I used a class Pokemon and made objects for each pokemon. Then they were put in an array of Objects and displayed thanks to a loop *ngFor.
